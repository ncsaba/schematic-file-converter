To run the eagle/construct code, you need to install the "construct" framework,
for docs on construct see:

http://construct.wikispaces.com/
https://github.com/construct/construct
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_%28python_library%29
http://construct.readthedocs.org/

What can be done right now is:


If you have eagle 6.1 installed on a linux system, this will do:
 * let eagle translate the given schematics file from the old version to the 6.1 XML version;
 * use the construct code to convert to the same 6.1 version;
 * diff the 2 XML files;
You can use this as an "oracle" for the correctness of the construct parser:

python upconvert/construct/eagle/xml_diff.py --eagle-path=/home/csaba/deploy/eagle test/eagle/Arduino%20Nano2.sch


This will dump all eagle records as they are, without any presumtions about
higher level structure between records, and will include the row data too:

python upconvert/construct/eagle/dump.py test/eagle/I2C%203-axis%20Compass.sch -R |less


This one has some limited structure presumtions about variable length records:

python upconvert/construct/eagle/dump.py test/eagle/I2C%203-axis%20Compass.sch -F |less


This one has strong presumtions about the high level structure of the records,
and parses the record stream in the hierarchical structure which is then used
when writing out the eagle XML format:

python upconvert/construct/eagle/dump.py test/eagle/I2C%203-axis%20Compass.sch -D |less
